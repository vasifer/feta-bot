# feta-bot

This is a twitter bot.
Retrieves tweets containing a keyword, then replaces that keyword with another word and retweets corrected tweet.
It's better to store in config module. Read more here: https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/

In the config module replace the xxxxx...xxxx's with proper twitter credentials (retain the quotes):
'''
consumer_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
consumer_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
access_token_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
'''
